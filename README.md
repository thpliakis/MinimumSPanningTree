# Prim's Algorithm implementation with an Abstract Data Type(ADT) and a Priority Queue

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim_algorithm

  This program read from a file a connected graph and calculates its minimum spanning tree.

  This is an update from my Dikjstra Algorithm implementation. But, in this code the Priority queue is used to sort the edges of the graph instead of the nodes. It was fun implementing this algorithm and i was very enthusiastic when it worked.
